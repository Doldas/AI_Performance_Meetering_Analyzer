# AI_Performance_Meetering_Analyzer
This is an AI Vision Performance Tool for measuring raw performance and the performance after image preprocessing.
It was developed

## Developed With:
* Angular 17
* Python 3
* Java 17

## Requirements:
* SQL Database (developed to work with Postgres)
* Nuget Package Manager (npm)
* PIP (Python 3 Package Manager)
* Python 3
* Java 17
* Node.js v18.*
* ng-cli

## Installation
Made to work with both Linux and Windows.
#### Installation
1. Install node.js.
2. Install npm
3. Install angular cli
4. Install postgres
5. Install Java 17
6. Install Python 3 and pip
7. Configure database settings in *"project/NexusAIEvaluator/backend/configs/dbconnect.json"*

In ./Frontend execute **npm install** cmd to install all dependencies.
In ./Backend execute **npm install** cmd to install all dependencies.
** In linux install_deps.sh can be used, In windows install_deps.bat can be used. **

## Using
To start the backend and frontend servers use a terminal and run **start_servers.bat** (Windows) or **start_servers.sh** (Linux).

Developed by Anton (Anle1802) and Milos (Miil1800) for a thesis on how image preprocessing affects the performance of different convolutional neural network models.

The study uses Open source Datasets containing medical images (Mammography and Microscopic).
